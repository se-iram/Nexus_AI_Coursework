# Nexus AI Course Work
This repository contains my hands-on deep learning work as part of the Nexus AI course.  
The goal is to learn core deep learning concepts and build mini-projects for each major architecture.

---

## What You'll Find Here
- **ANN Projects** – Basic neural networks for image classification  
- **CNN Projects** – Convolutional networks for advanced image tasks *(coming soon)*  
- **RNN Projects** – Recurrent models for sequence data *(coming soon)*  
- **Generative AI** – Projects related to text/image generation *(coming soon)*

## Goal of This Repo
To apply what I learn in each topic by building real mini-projects, visualizing model performance, and improving my understanding of deep learning concepts with PyTorch & tensors.
