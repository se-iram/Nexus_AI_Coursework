# Sign Language Letter Classifier

This is my first deep learning project where I built a neural network using PyTorch to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) letters from images.

The dataset used is from Kaggle: [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Takes hand sign images and predicts the corresponding alphabet letter (A-Z, skipping J)
- Trained using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model
- Achieved ~77% test accuracy
- Visualizes model predictions

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Sign Language MNIST Dataset

## 🏁 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download the notebook
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step
4. You’ll need internet to fetch the dataset using `kagglehub`

## ✅ Features

- Data loading and visualization
- Neural network training loop
- Accuracy evaluation
- Random image predictions

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Use a CNN model instead of MLP for better performance
- Add GUI or web interface to upload and predict live images

**Note**: This is a beginner project. I created it as part of my learning journey in Deep Learning.
